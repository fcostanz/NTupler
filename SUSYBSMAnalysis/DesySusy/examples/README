Try the following examples either within a native root environment
(e.g. ini ROOT52800 on NAF) or within CMSSW.
Depending on your ROOT installation you may get:
   warning: ‘variable’ may be used uninitialized 
these can be ignored and disapear if you run within cmssw.

// a simple code to pick electrons
root -q -b electron.C++

// a first try for a Ra4 analysis
root -q -b ra4.C++

There are examples on how to compile the code in the directory 'compiled'.
