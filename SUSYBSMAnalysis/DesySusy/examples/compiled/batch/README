runOnAll indir [outdir] executable [config] [script] [cleanUp] [noJoin]

You need in the directory from where the jobs are started:

The batch starter script                            : runOnAll 
the executable                                  e.g.: myAnalysis
configuration_file for the executable if needed e.g.: config_RA5.txt

./runOnAll /scratch/hh/current/cms/user/kruecker/ntuples/data2011/Run2011A/DoubleMu/  myAnalysis config_RA5.txt
./runOnAll /store/user/kruecker/ntuples/data2011/Run2011A/DoubleMu_v2 output myAnalysis config_RA5.txt cleanUp

optional:
Your own batch script e.g.: myJob
./runOnAll /store/user/kruecker/ntuples/data2011/Run2011A/DoubleMu_v2  myAnalysis myJob config_RA5.txt

There are 2 special keywords on the command line:
Erase the individual root files: cleanUp
Do not run the merging step:     noJoin

runOnAll reads $LD_LIBRARY_PATH to get the correct libraries. Make shure that the executable can run in the 
environment where you start runOnAll. In addition it takes the path to hadd.

dcache support is added
/store will be translated into /pnfs/desy.de/cms/tier2/store
