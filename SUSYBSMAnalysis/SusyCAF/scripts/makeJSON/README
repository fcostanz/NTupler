The command

./findRuns.py run_number

will create a 2 json files for all runs > run_number.

        jsonls.txt    :   the standard good run/LS list
NONEPOG_jsonls.txt    :   the same but ignoring the POGs (Egamma,Muon,JetMET,Track)

In additions config snippets are created:
           cfg.txt
   NONEPOG_cfg.txt

Up to now there is only 1 run (133082) where all DPG are good and one of the POG is not good. Therefore in most cases 
(i.e. for run_number>133082) there will be no NONEPOG lists.

The runreg.cfg file is used to steer the program. DBS access must be included to get the same results as in the 
official jsonls.txt. 

findRun.py is a modification of runregparse.py described in 
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/Collisions2010Recipes#Helper_script

In addition there is a little utillity to compare json files:
./showJsonDiff jsonls_1.txt jsonls_2.txt

Example: 
1.) a list of all good runs in 2010
./findRuns.py 

2.) a list of new runs
The last (7th May 2010) official json file
https://cms-service-dqm.web.cern.ch/cms-service-dqm/CAF/certification/Cert_132440-133928_StreamExpress_Commissioning10-Express_DQM_JSON.txt
contains all runs up to 134987. If you want to get a list of new runs/LS since that run
./findRuns.py 134987
